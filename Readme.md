# CS-382 | Machine Learning

This repository contains implementations of **Machine Learning algorithms** taught in the **CS-382 (Machine Learning)** course.  
It is created and maintained throughout the semester for **academic learning, practice, and revision**.

The repository will be **continuously updated** as new algorithms are covered in the course.

---

## 📌 Contents

The following algorithms are currently implemented:

- **MP Neuron**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**

More algorithms will be added progressively, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.
