# CS-382 | Machine Learning

This repository contains implementations of **Machine Learning algorithms** taught in the **CS-382 (Machine Learning)** course.  
It is created and maintained throughout the semester for **academic learning, practice, and revision**.

The repository will be **continuously updated** as new algorithms are covered in the course.

---

## Contents

The following algorithms are currently implemented:

- **MP Neuron**
- **Linear Regression**
- **Ridge Regression**

More algorithms will be added progressively, including supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the **theoretical foundations** of machine learning algorithms  
- Implement algorithms **from scratch** for better conceptual clarity  
- Analyze model behavior through experimentation  
- Build a strong base for advanced ML topics
